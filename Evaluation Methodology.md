# Evaluation Methodology for MoAMs-CognIToM-Twin Framework

The performance of the MoAMs-CognIToM-Twin framework will be evaluated across four key dimensions, each focusing on critical aspects of cognitive digital twin functionality:

## 1. Cognitive Performance Metrics:
- **Decision Accuracy**: Will measure the correct action selection rate based on system decisions.
- **Learning Rate**: Will track improvements in task performance over time through iterative learning.
- **Adaptation Speed**: Will evaluate the time taken to adjust to environmental changes, ensuring responsiveness.

## 2. Agent Coordination Efficiency:
- **Communication Latency**: Will assess the average time for message delivery between agents.
- **Task Allocation Success Rate**: Will measure the percentage of successfully delegated and completed tasks across agents.
- **Conflict Resolution Time**: Will evaluate the average time required to resolve inter-agent conflicts effectively.

## 3. System Scalability:
- **Agent Scaling Efficiency**: Will analyze the impact on system performance when adding new agents or microservices.
- **Resource Utilization**: Will monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to ensure efficient resource management.
- **Knowledge Graph Update Speed**: Will measure the time required to incorporate new information into the knowledge graph.

## 4. Real-Time Response:
- **Action Execution Latency**: Will track the time from decision-making to action execution in dynamic environments.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Will evaluate the accuracy of real-time state predictions for informed decision-making.
- **System Responsiveness**: Will assess end-to-end processing time for handling inputs and generating outputs.

This evaluation methodology will ensure a comprehensive assessment of the framework's cognitive capabilities, scalability, and real-time adaptability, providing insights into its practical effectiveness across various domains.
