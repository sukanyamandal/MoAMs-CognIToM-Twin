**This file contains a pseudocode of MoAMs Coordinator Implementation**

```python
class MoAMsCoordinator:
    def coordinate_agents(self, task_requirements):
        # Hierarchical task decomposition
        subtasks = self.decompose_task(task_requirements)
        
        # Agent assignment based on capabilities
        assignments = self.assign_agents(subtasks)
        
        # Establish communication channels
        channels = self.setup_communication(assignments)
        
        # Consensus mechanism
        consensus = self.achieve_consensus(assignments)
        
        return consensus, channels
```
